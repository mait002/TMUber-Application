This project, TMUber, is a ride-sharing and delivery application developed as part of a class project. The app offers essential features such as user and driver registration, service request handling (including requesting, canceling, and modifying ride or delivery requests), and trip and delivery tracking. TMUber was designed with a focus on scalability and user-friendly functionality, making it a foundational prototype for real-world applications in the ride-sharing and delivery sector.
